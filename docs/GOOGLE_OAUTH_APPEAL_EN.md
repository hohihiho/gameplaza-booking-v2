# Google OAuth Appeal (English)

## Why Bot Fails (Common Issues)
1. Bot checks static HTML, not JavaScript-rendered content
2. Bot may be checking cached/old version
3. Bot looks for exact text "Privacy Policy" in English
4. Bot expects privacy link in header, not footer

## Solution: Make Privacy Link More Obvious

### Option 1: Add Static HTML Privacy Link in Header
Add a visible privacy link at the top of the homepage that bots can easily detect.

### Option 2: Create New OAuth Client (Fastest Solution)
Skip the verification process entirely:
1. Create new OAuth Client ID
2. Set to **Testing** mode
3. Add test users (up to 100)
4. Use immediately without verification

## Appeal Template (English)

**Subject**: OAuth Consent Screen Review Error - Appeal

**Content**:
```
Hello Google OAuth Team,

I am appealing the rejection of my OAuth consent screen verification.

## Rejection Reasons Received:
1. "Homepage does not have a privacy policy link"
2. "Privacy policy URL is the same as homepage URL"

## Actual Configuration:
- Application Homepage: https://www.gameplaza.kr
- Privacy Policy: https://www.gameplaza.kr/privacy
- Terms of Service: https://www.gameplaza.kr/terms

## Evidence:
1. The homepage (https://www.gameplaza.kr) contains a privacy policy link in the footer
2. The privacy policy URL (https://www.gameplaza.kr/privacy) is DIFFERENT from the homepage URL
3. The privacy policy page contains all required information:
   - Types of data collected (including Google OAuth data)
   - How data is used
   - Data retention periods
   - Third-party sharing policies
   - User rights
   - Contact information

## Technical Note:
The website is a React SPA (Single Page Application). The privacy link is rendered via JavaScript. 
If your automated checker only reads static HTML, it may not see the dynamically rendered content.

## Verification:
Please manually verify by visiting:
1. https://www.gameplaza.kr (see footer for privacy link)
2. https://www.gameplaza.kr/privacy (separate privacy policy page)

## Request:
Please re-review the application or escalate to human review.

## How to Bypass Bot Issues

### 1. Add English "Privacy Policy" Text
The bot looks for English text. Add this to your footer:
```html
<Link href="/privacy">
  개인정보처리방침 | Privacy Policy
</Link>
```

### 2. Add Privacy Link in Multiple Places
- Header (most important for bot)
- Footer
- Homepage content

### 3. Add Meta Tags
```html
<link rel="privacy-policy" href="https://www.gameplaza.kr/privacy">
<meta name="privacy-policy" content="https://www.gameplaza.kr/privacy">
```

### 4. Server-Side Rendering
Make sure privacy link is in initial HTML, not just client-rendered.

## Fastest Solution: Skip Verification

**Create Test Mode OAuth Client:**
```bash
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Create new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Configure OAuth consent screen:
   - Publishing status: "Testing"
   - Add test users (your emails)
4. Use new Client ID/Secret
5. No verification needed!
```

## Expected Timeline
- Bot re-check: 1-2 days (usually fails again)
- Human review: 3-5 days (usually succeeds)
- Test mode: Immediate (no verification needed)

## Recommendation
**Don't wait for verification. Use test mode OAuth client for now.**
You can serve 100 users immediately while waiting for production approval.
